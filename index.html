        <h3>Excel Data Extraction With Python</h3>
        <p>Part of ANL503 Graded Assignments. In this short project, a resuable Python script was created to read in twelve Excel documents and upload them directly into a MySQL database. The sheet name to be extracted in each file differs 
          and the postion of the sheet also varies across each excel file. A single query was then created with the help of a Python script to combine the twelve tables into one.</p>
